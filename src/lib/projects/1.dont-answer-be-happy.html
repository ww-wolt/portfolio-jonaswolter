			<p id="abstract">
				The installation "Don't Answer Be Happy" creates an interactive experience in which everything revolves around the personal smartphone. Engrossed in a
				conversation between their own personal smartphone and the surrounding artificial intelligence, visitors are compelled to take a stand. Confrontations
				with the<em> </em>ambivalence of digital reality arise, and evasion is not possible. The experienced space reflects upon the digital colonization
				regarding people and regions of this world outside of global tech hotspots.<br /><br />

	  <h3>Background</h3>
		<p>
			Conceptually the installation addresses the discourse of globalized technology and peeks behind the curtain of the hype surrounding artificial
			intelligence. It examines how technological developments impact society and what this means for different regions and people of this world. Many tech
			solutions that have become indispensable in the global North and to which we have become accustomed can only exist through the systematic exploitation of
			the global South. Without the major discrepancy in income and living conditions, we would not be able to live out this tech luxury to this extent. The
			installation "Don't Answer Be Happy" focuses on the people who make Western tech luxury possible in the first place through their daily work in precarious
			conditions, be it clickwork in the creation of datasets that serve as the basis for AI algorithms, in content moderation, in the production of electronic
			devices or in their recycling.

		<h3>Narration</h3>
		<p>
			For the installation we developed a narrative around the personal smartphone, which deals with the issues described previously. The smartphone is the
			focal point and the depicting element that perfectly represents the difficulties created by technological globalization and digital colonization. In the
			installation the role of the visitor is inverted. The visitor is degraded to a clickworker and only acts as an extended arm of the smartphone. The
			smartphone develops an intelligence, but does not understand the irrationality and contradictory nature of human interaction with technology and begins to
			ask naive questions to its user. The visitor is confronted with questions and is required to take a stance.
		</p>
		<h3>Interaction</h3>
		<p>
			The smartphone as the focal point of the different conflicts is also the interactive element. A new type of interaction was specifically developed for
			this installation, based on gyroscope data of the smartphone, which is accessed via a web application. All visual and auditory experiences in the space
			are based on the rotation of the smartphone. The visitor also provides answers to the questions by pointing the smartphone at different projections,
			resulting in an immersive experience.
